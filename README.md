# Learning CPP

Lessons learned from a collection of C++ resources. This repository contains content from
- learncpp.com
- C++ Software Design
- C++17
- cracked.io
- leetcode

These are mostly things that I learned and wanted to note down as I consumed these materials. It's
not a comprehensive summary and shouldn't be treated as a replacement. However, I think you might
find some things useful.
