Compiliation process
1. Compiler checks code for syntactcial errors
2. Copmiler translates C++ to machine language instructions and stores it in intermediate files called object files. Each source file generates an object file.
3. Linker combines all of the object files and produces a single executable. The linker first reads in each object file and then resolves cross file dependencies. Then the linker links library files (precompiled code for reuse in other programs)
